# RUHungry

## Overview
RU Hungry is a Java-based restaurant management simulation where you manage a fictional restaurant by handling the menu, stock, transactions, and guests. The project involves hash tables, separate chaining, object referencing, and OOP principles. Your task is to run RU Hungry for a day by seating guests, taking orders, managing donations, and restocking the pantry.

## Features
- **Menu Management**: Create and manage the restaurant's menu using hash tables and linked lists.
- **Stock Management**: Handle the stockroom inventory with efficient searching, adding, and updating using hash tables with chaining.
- **Transactions**: Record all transactions (orders, donations, restocks) in a linked list for end-of-day receipts.
- **Seating Guests**: Efficiently seat guests based on table availability and manage the waiting queue.
- **Order Processing**: Check dish availability and process customer orders, including handling out-of-stock scenarios.
- **Donations**: Manage donations to the Rutgers Pantry, ensuring sufficient profit for donations to occur.

## Data Structures
- **1D Arrays**: For restaurant seating and menu categories.
- **Hash Tables**: For managing stock with ingredient IDs as keys.
- **Linked Lists**: For menu items, stock items, and transactions.
- **Queues**: For managing the waiting list of guests.

## Concepts Covered
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Hash Tables and Separate Chaining
- Linked Lists and Queues
- File I/O for reading input files
- Efficient searching and updating mechanisms
